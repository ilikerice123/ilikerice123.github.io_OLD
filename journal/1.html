                            Wow, it has been already more than a week since my last blog post on here,
                            but to me it has only felt like a few days. I guess I have an excuse tho,
                            since over thhe long weekend (civic holiday), my parents came to visit from
                            toronto, and I trained over to meet them there.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            We did the usual toronto things, like go to the CN tower, visit niagara falls,
                            uot, browse uniqlo graphic tees (which were really nice by the way!) etc. The
                            two days went by very quickly. Then, they drove all the way here to Ottawa to 
                            cook some meals for me and stay take a look around Ottawa for a day or two as 
                            well.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            It went pretty much as expected - I had a lot of fun spending time with my
                            brother again, and being with my family was also really enjoyable. However,
                            one thing that really stuck out to me that I really didn't consider was how
                            much I missed my parents. How much my parents' and my brother's unconditional
                            love really meant to me. Sure, we had a few arguments over where we should park
                            in downtown Toronto (traffic really is even a bigger mess there than in vancouver)
                            and also about whether or not marijuana should be legalized (I really think that
                            if alcohol and cigarettes are already legal, marijuana should fall under the same
                            umbrella), but for the most part, I be as genuine to my true self as physically 
                            possible.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I consider myself to be a pretty introverted guy (I guess I'm not really sure 
                            if I'm just introverted, or just really shy, or maybe both), but I do feel like 
                            I could keep up a conversation if I was forced to, BUT BY BEING INOFFENSIVE. I 
                            think that's my biggest problem. When I talk to others, I'm so busy obssessing 
                            over how other people will feel about what I say that I often just take the 
                            inoffensive route and not say anything at all. This is not to say that I DON'T 
                            open up to people at all, but I do feel like it's a major roadblock when it comes 
                            to meeting new people (which I'm doing on coop!), and is pretty exhausting. 
                            However, in front of my parents, I genuinely feel so at home, and so unconditionally
                            loved that I don't to put up any "walls" so to speak.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            And I'm really going to miss that feeling of being completely free and surrounded
                            by people that love me for the next four months. Being at home alone, cooking your 
                            own meals, and being self-sufficient with everyone around you expecting you to be 
                            excelling at your coop (which, might I add, technically speaking, I'd say I'm doing
                            pretty good ðŸ˜‰) really takes its toll on me personally.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I guess this is sort of a depressing blog entry, but hopefully in the future, I can
                            come back to this, look at it, and smile, shaking my head at how naive I am now. 
                            But I do feel like what I'm writing does hold a grain of truth for me in my current
                            state. Perhaps it is also due to other issues that I won't go into right now that's 
                            causing me to write in such a pessimistic fashion. O well, you know what they say,
                            life's a rollercoaster!

                        Reviving an Old Project and the Perils of a Software Engineer
                    </div>
                    <div class="blog-content">
                        <p>
                            So last year, in an attempt to improve my net-worth to potential
                            employers I fiddled around to make an android app to convince not 
                            only coop companies but also myself that I'm at least a somewhat
                            competent software engineer. My app was called "Track My Time", and
                            basically what it would do is you would add places that you would 
                            like to track, and using gps locations on your phone, it would try 
                            and track how long you spend in each location. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            This app actually worked quite well - it did what it was supposed to do,
                            to my surprise, and was probably only off by only a few minutes after a 
                            week of attending lectures. However, for some weird reason, it broke, maybe
                            about a month into "finishing" it (cuz projects are never finished ðŸ˜¤),
                            and since I had already found a coop and school was getting busy with 
                            project deadlines coming up, I prompty forgot about it...until 3 days ago.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I was on the train with a bunch of coworkers and I was showing them how my 
                            app was supposed to work, and I was like "hey, for fun, I'm going to press
                            the start tracking locations button. in the past this would have started
                            the parselocationservice and started tracking your data!". Back then, I was 
                            stupid and didn't know how to use the logging feature (log.cat) on android,
                            so I toasted everything (LOL), which resulted in huge toasts filling up my 
                            entire screen, and to my big surprise, these annoying toasts kept popping 
                            up! It was like a miracle!
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The problem with my app before was that whenever someone swiped away the app,
                            it would just force-close, and the service wouldn't persist, but for some 
                            peculiar reason, that wasn't the case this time. So, now 3 days later, with 
                            some spare time on my hands before I sleep, I decided to boot into linux and 
                            open up my app and see if I can figure out what was wrong.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Lemme just start off saying that, holy crap, me from one year ago was a fricken
                            trooper. For the past 3 months, I've been writing code on a 3 monitor setup, 2 
                            high resolution big monitors and one laptop screen. However, my laptop at home is 
                            a mediocre 14in 1600x900 LOOOL. I have ABSOLUTELY no clue how I developed ANYTHING
                            on this without pulling my hair out or developing some rare eye disease. I guess
                            ignorance is bliss... now how am I supposed to go back to school now with only my 
                            work laptop after my coop term ends??
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Picture for reference:
                            <img src="../images/computer_screen.png" style="max-width:100%; max-height: 100%">
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            The second thing I noticed was the ABSOLUTE mess that was my code. I have comments 
                            thrown in haphazardly, some of them witty, some of them useful, but the majority of
                            them were written without any forethought on how someone reading them in the future
                            with no context of the situation might interpret them. There were many foreign 
                            methods and concepts cooked into my code that I had no idea where to start. The 
                            funny thing is, I distinctly remember younger me thinking "o man, look at these 
                            comments that I'm writing, I'll be able to go back to this code at any time and 
                            just pick up where I left off!". Honestly, how I felt looking at my code at that 
                            moment was not that dissimilar to how a layman, after finding that their car broke
                            down in the middle of the road, would feel when they open their car hood and a 
                            hiss of steam rises out of it. Just like the layman, I have a general idea of 
                            what all my classes do, but no specific details on how it does it. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Well after looking around and poking at the jumbled jenga that is my code, I realized
                            that I had two classes doing the same thing. I had distinctly remembered one of these
                            was deprecated, and I thought for sure I put a comment at the top saying which one was,
                            but I could find no such thing. After tracing through my code, I realized that the
                            service it was calling in fact didn't have any method to handle the location that
                            was being passed into it. I checked the other class and it did, so guess what I did, 
                            I copied it over from the other class and woop-d-doo it seems my app has spluttered 
                            to a start again and is now noisily idling at the side of the road, waiting for me to 
                            drive it until it breaks again. :D 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            I guess the main takeaway for this is that not only should I write CLEAN code, and 
                            comment regularly, I have to write THOUGHTFUL and CONCISE comments as well. Nobody 
                            (including myself who wrote the code even) wants to slog through paragraphs of incoherent
                            commented text to hear the ramblings of a sleep-deprived cpen student. Comments in 
                            source code should be for the code itself. Save everything else for blogs (like this!).
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            As an afterthought: When opened my app, I noticed that in my android manifest file, since I declared my app
                            for a certain version of android api, a lot of the things were deprecated, or the 
                            ide encouraged me to update my classes and such to use the latest features. This got me 
                            thinking: even though my app could be in a finished and working state now, if I don't 
                            keep up with the constant updates and upgrades that android receives, my app is going
                            to be dead in maybe as little as a year. Thus is the life of a software engineer 
                            designing solutions to problems on a continously evolving platform.

                        Alright, so after some many weeks of laziness and struggle, I have 
                        finally got something that resembles a website - a welcome page and 
                        a semi-usable super ugly blog format that I will work on as the time
                        goes on. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Right now, in order to post a blog entry, I had a commented 
                        out blog entry skeleton at the top of this html that I can just copy
                        and paste into the actual html to write a blog entry. This feels like 
                        something a random 8th grader can do and nothing close to what a semi-
                        professional university cpen student should be able to accomplish. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        For that, I willl just have to blame github's static sites XD. The lack 
                        of an interactable and programmable server really hinders my ability to 
                        do cool things outside of javascript (have you seen people write entire
                        physics engines on this stuff? js is pretty cool despite all the hate 
                        it gets as a language!). O well. Once I retire my current thinkpad for a 
                        better laptop, I will consider using my old computer as a dedicated server
                        and registering for some free domain name after the fact.

                        For now I will be stuck using this primitive software to deliver my 
                        updates and hopefully I will be able to create something here that I can
                        come back in 10 years and look at with nostalgia and fondness.
