                    Want to design, build, and give life to a team of cutting-edge robots? 
                    This is the place to be!
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    The Thunderbots are an entirely student run team of thirty plus 
                    engineering and computer science students dedicated to creating a 
                    team of autonomous soccer-playing robots to compete at the 
                    international RoboCup competition. Together they tackle both the 
                    technical and administrative aspects of a project, gaining a valuable 
                    university experience that cannot be provided in the classroom. 
                    They meet regularly one evening a week and Saturdays to work on their 
                    projects with other members of the team.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Thunderbots prides itself on being a highly competitive and finds its 
                    success in an environment of multi-disciplinary teamwork, mentorship, 
                    and student-directed learning. All skill levels are welcome! We recruit 
                    first years to graduate students. All we ask for is that you have 
                    dedication, enthusiasm, and an eagerness to learn about robotics. The 
                    technical projects are highly involved, but, when accomplished, are 
                    very rewarding.

                    <br>
                    The team is not currently recruiting new members. However, if you are 
                    interested in joining the team, we welcome everyone to apply during 
                    our next recruitment cycle in September!
